This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you…

Can write programs and tests using Node.js and npm
Can use problem decomposition to split difficult problems into smaller parts
Have used pseudocode as an intermediary step in writing a program
Are interested in common computer science algorithms
Are interested in critical thinking and problem solving
Description

This is a sub-goal of Core Algorithms. Reference that goal for more description, context, and resources.

Complete ONLY the Classic, Numeric, and Set Operations algorithms, not the Sorting/Searching or Graphing/Geometry. That’s a separate goal. :)
